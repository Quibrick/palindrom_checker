Classic code which checks if the word you provide is a palindrome.

You provide a word into the program . If the length of the word is 1 then it returns 'Length = 1 '

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
If the word is a Palindrome it returns a list that contains the letters and a dictionary that contain the word as the key and the length of the word as the value.
